# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete TUI Keyboard Layout Editor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2024-11-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, comprehensive, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- 10 user stories organized by priority (P1-P3) covering all major features
- 30 detailed functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-030)
- 15 measurable success criteria with specific time/performance targets
- 13 key entities fully described with attributes and relationships
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Clear assumptions and dependencies documented
- Well-defined scope with explicit out-of-scope items

**Validation Summary**:
- ✅ User-centered: All stories focus on user workflows and value
- ✅ Technology-agnostic: Success criteria measure outcomes, not implementations
- ✅ Testable: Every requirement has clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Independent: Each user story can be tested standalone
- ✅ Complete: No missing sections or clarifications needed
